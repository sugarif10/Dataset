# Abortion rates (per 1000 women) - Sedgh et al. (2016)

Estimated incidence of abortions at global, regional and sub-regional levels over the period 1990-2014. This is measured as the number of abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 years old.

The authors used abortion data from government agencies and compiled data from international sources and nationally representative studies to produce global and regional estimates. Utilising data for 1069 country-years, incidence was estimated using a Bayesian hierarchical time series model whereby the overall abortion rate is a function of the modelled rates in subgroups of women of reproductive age.

Data was reported over the period 1990-2014 in five-year intervals. Here we allocate the given data point to the final year of the five-year interval: i.e. "1994" denotes the period 1990-1994; "1999" denotes 1995-1999; [...], "2014" denotes 2010-2014.
