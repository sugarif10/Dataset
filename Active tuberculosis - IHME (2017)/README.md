# Active tuberculosis - IHME (2017)

This dataset presents the prevalence of active tuberculosis (TB) by country, region, and globally.

TB is a preventable, curable, and treatable infectious disease that usually affects the lungs, and can cause death without proper treatment.

A large share of the population has latent TB, which means they have been infected by TB bacteria but are not ill with the disease and cannot transmit the disease. People with compromised immune systems, such as those living with HIV or malnutrition, have a high risk of falling ill with active TB.

Figures were calculated by Our World in Data based on data provided by the Institute of Health Metrics Evaluations (IHME). For the prevalence of active TB, we calculated the difference between the prevalence of TB and latent TB.
