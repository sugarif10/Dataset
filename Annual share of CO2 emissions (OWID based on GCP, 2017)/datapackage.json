This is calculated as each country's share of the sum of all country emissions; this does not include international aviation and shipping ('bunkers') and 'statistical differences'.\n\nRaw emissions data was from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664.\n\nArchived data is held at the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC).
