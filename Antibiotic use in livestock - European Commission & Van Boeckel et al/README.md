# Antibiotic use in livestock - European Commission & Van Boeckel et al.

Data on antibiotic use in livestock was derived from multiple sources.

Antibiotic use across Europe is typically well-reported by the European Commission, allowing for the use of time-series trends. Time-series data from 2010-2015 for European countries was therefore sourced from:  European Medicines Agency, European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption, 2017.
‘Sales of veterinary antimicrobial agents in 30 European countries in 2015’. (EMA/184855/2017). Available at: http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Report/2017/10/WC500236750.pdf.

Additional data for the United Kingdom in 2016 was sourced from: UK-VARSS 2016; UK – Veterinary Antibiotic Resistance
and Sales Surveillance Report (2017). Available at: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/655403/_1274590_VARSS_2016_report.PDF

Global-level estimates by country for the year 2010 were published by: Van Boeckel, T. P., Brower, C., Gilbert, M., Grenfell, B. T., Levin, S. A., Robinson, T. P., ... & Laxminarayan, R. (2015). Global trends in antimicrobial use in food animals. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 112(18), 5649-5654. Available at: http://www.pnas.org/content/112/18/5649.full.pdf
Full data from Boeckel et al. (2015) is available by the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy (CDDEP). Available at: https://resistancemap.cddep.org/AnimalUse.php

Antibiotic use is normalised to the average consumption per kilogram of meat production. This correction for livestock population sizes and types is termed 'population-corrected unit' (PCU). Data is reported as the milligrams of total antibiotic ingredient per PCU (mg/PCU), which translates to mg per kilogram of meat production (mg/kg meat).
