# Antibiotic use in livestock 2030 - Boeckel et al. (2017)

Boeker et al. (2017) project global antibiotic use under business-as-usual antibiotic concentrations and projected meat consumption.

The authors also project a number of potential reduction scenarios:
- a global limit of 50 milligrams of antibiotic use per kilogram of meat production.
- a limit of 50 milligrams of antibiotic use per kilogram of meat production for OECD countries & China.
- global per capita meat consumption of 40 grams per day (the equivalent of an average burger patty)
- global per capita meat consumption of 165 grams per day (the projected EU average in 2030)

Projected global antibiotic use for livestock are shown for each of these potential reduction scenarios.
