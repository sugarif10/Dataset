# Arable land per crop output (PIN) (FAO, 2019)

This metric measures the index of arable land needed to produce a fixed quantity of crops (where values in 1961 are equal to 1.0). 

This is calculated as arable land divided by the crop production index (PIN). The crop production index (PIN) here is the sum of crop commodities produced (after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed). It is weighted by the commodity prices. 

Values for arable land use and the crop production index (PIN) is sourced from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
