The crop production index (PIN) here is the sum of crop commodities produced (after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed). It is weighted by the commodity prices. \n\nValues for arable land use and the crop production index (PIN) is sourced from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). ",
