# CFC-11 expected and measured concentrations (Montzka et al. 2018)

Data denotes the measured concentrations of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) gas in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, collected via air collection and analysis automated onsite instrumentation with gas chromatography coupled with electron capture detection (GCâ€“ECD). This allows for measurement of CFC-11 concentrations in mole fractions (parts per trillion). Data here represents the annual average for data reported in Montzka et al. (2018).

The WMO (2003; 2010 and 2014) projections are those published by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and represent the global average expected change in CFC-11 concentrations based on reported emissions of CFC-11 from all parties to the Montreal Protocol.
