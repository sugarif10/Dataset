This allows for measurement of CFC-11 concentrations in mole fractions (parts per trillion). Data here represents the annual average for data reported in Montzka et al. (2018).\n\nThe WMO (2003; 2010 and 2014) projections are those published by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and represent the global average expected change in CFC-11 concentrations based on reported emissions of CFC-11 from all parties to the Montreal Protocol.",
