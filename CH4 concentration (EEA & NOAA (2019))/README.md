# CH4 concentration (EEA & NOAA (2019))

Global annual averaged atmospheric concentration of methane (CHâ‚„), measured in parts per billion (ppb).

The series was merged by Our World in Data based on data from the European Environment Agency (EEA) & National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Data from the EEA is used until 2016; thereafter data is sourced from the NOAA.

Original EEA data is derived from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE), available at: https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/external/agage-measurements.
