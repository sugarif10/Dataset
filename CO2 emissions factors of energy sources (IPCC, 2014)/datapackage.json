These emissions factors include all greenhouse gases (normalised to carbon dioxide-equivalents) and stages of the supply chain, including direct combustion, infrastructure and supply chains, and albedo effect.\n\nAll figures, with the exception of oil are sourced from the IPCC's AR5 Working Group III Annex: https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-iii.pdf\n\nEmissions factors are given for select electricity sources in gCO₂/kWh – which does not include crude oil. To derive a comparable emissions factor for oil, we have taken the emissions factor for coal in gCO₂/kWh and multiplied it by the ratio of coal-to-oil default emissions factors in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, available here: https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_1_Ch1_Introduction.pdf\n\nSo, the emissions factor for oil is derived as 833gCO₂eq/kWh * [73 300 / 98 300] = 611 gCO₂eq/kWh.",
