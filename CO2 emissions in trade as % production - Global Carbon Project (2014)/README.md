# CO2 emissions in trade as % production - Global Carbon Project (2014)

Original data on production-based emissions, and emissions transfers in trade from Peters et al. (2012) via the Global Carbon Project (http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/16/data.htm) have been manipulated to calculate the emissions transfers as a percentage of production-based emissions, presented in this chart.
