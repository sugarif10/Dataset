# CO2 emissions scenarios - Climate Action Tracker

Future greenhouse gas emissions can take various pathways: all with variable impacts on climatic outcomes.

The pathways represented here are based on the basis of no climate policies; current policies implemented; pledges by all countries within the Paris agreement, and 2C and 1.5C consistent pathways. 

Each scenario incorporates a range of uncertain potential pathways - these are shown as upper and lower bounds for each.
