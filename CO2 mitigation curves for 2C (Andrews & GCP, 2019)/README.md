# CO2 mitigation curves for 2C (Andrews & GCP, 2019)

Data denotes the range of CO2 mitigation curves for a range of 'start year scenarios': scenarios are based on the annual emission reductions necessary to keep global temperature rise below 2C if emissions mitigation was to start in a given year. 

For example, 'Start in 2010' marks the necessary future emissions pathway to have a >66% chance of keeping global average temperatures below 2C warming if global CO2 emissions mitigation had started in 2010, very quickly peaking then falling.

Historical emissions to 2017 are sourced from CDIAC/Global Carbon Project, projection to 2018 from Global Carbon Project (Le Quéré et al. 2018).

Global cumulative CO2 emissions budgets are from the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C (Rogelj et al 2018): 420 GtCO2 for a 66% of 1.5°C and 1170 GtCO2 for a 66% of 2°C. Mitigation curves describe approximately exponential decay pathways such that the quota is never exceeded (see Raupach et al., 2014).
