# Conflict and Terrorism deaths - OWID based on IHME & GTD

Data for conflict and terrorism deaths has been differentiated by Our World in Data based on published figures by the IHME, Global Burden of Disease (GBD), and Global Terrorism Database (GTD).

The IHME, GBD report combined deaths from 'Conflict and Terrorism'. To differentiate 'conflict' deaths, we have subtracted number of terrorism deaths published by the GTD from this combined metric of 'Conflict and Terrorism'. 

We have also calculated both of these individual parameters in terms of the percentage of total deaths, by dividing by IHME figures of deaths for 'All causes'.

Note that in some cases, estimates of homicide, conflict and terrorism can be challenging to differentiate, with different estimates from different sources and definitions. For terrorism, we have used data from the GTD; full data and definitions can be found at our entry: www.ourworldindata.org/terrorism
