# Conflict deaths â€“ UCDP Georeferenced Event Data (2019)

UCDP (GED) v19.1 provides estimates for direct conflict deaths (i.e. excluding indirect deaths from disease, malnutrition, exposure etc.) of both civilians and military personnel occurring in individual geo-referenced events. Taking the 'best' deaths estimates, we have aggregated these to country-year observations.

UCDP documentation makes it clear that the dataset is intended to have global coverage since 1989, except for the case of Syria. As such, any country-year (as defined by the Gleditsch and Ward system of states) in which no events are recorded in the data were attributed zero deaths, except for Syria in this period.

The World total figures are not an aggregation of the GED dataset (given the lack of coverage just mentioned). Instead it combines the three non-georeferenced datasets UCDP provides, covering three kinds of violence: One-sided violence, Non-state conflicts and State-based conflicts.

Death rates are calculated using UN population figures.
