# Cumulative CO2 emissions (OWID based on GCP & CDIAC (2018))

Cumulative carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions have been calculated by Our World in Data based on annual CO₂ emissions published by the Global Carbon Project (GCP) and Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC). By summing the annual emissions to a given year we have calculated the cumulative total. 

This is given as the share of global cumulative emissions by dividing each country or region's cumulative emissions by the cumulative world emissions for that given year. 

Data has been converted by Our World in Data from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664.

Our World in Data has also defined the following regions as: 
– "Asia & Pacific (other)" is Asia and Oceania totals minus China and India
– "Americas (other)" is North, Central, South America and the Caribbean minus the USA
– "Europe (other)" is Western and Eastern Europe minus the EU-28.

"Statistical differences" are referred to by the Global Carbon Project as the difference between global emissions and the sum of all national emissions plus bunker fuels: this discrepancy is therefore categorized as "statistical differences".

Our World in Data have renamed the category "bunker fuels" as "International transport" which includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. We have renamed this category for clarity.

Historical data for Australia in CDIAC from 1820 until 1860 reports negative CO2 emissions. In this dataset, pre-1860 data for Australia has been removed.

Data from pre-1959 is sourced from the archived Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC). Reference: Tom Boden and Bob Andres (Oak Ridge National Laboratory); Gregg Marland (Appalachian State University). Available at: http://cdiac.ornl.gov/

Data from 1959 onwards is sourced from the Global Carbon Project (2018).
