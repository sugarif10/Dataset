  "description": "Cumulative carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions have been calculated by Our World in Data based on annual CO₂ emissions published by the Global Carbon Project (GCP) and Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC). By summing the annual emissions to a given year we have calculated the cumulative total. \n\nThis is given as the share of global cumulative emissions by dividing each country or region's cumulative emissions by the cumulative world emissions for that given year. \n\nData has been converted by Our World in Data from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664.\n\nOur World in Data has also defined the following regions as: \n– \"Asia & Pacific (other)\" is Asia and Oceania totals minus China and India\n– \"Americas (other)\" is North, Central, South America and the Caribbean minus the USA\n– \"Europe (other)\" is Western and Eastern Europe minus the EU-28.\n\n\"Statistical differences\" are referred to by the Global Carbon Project as the difference between global emissions and the sum of all national emissions plus bunker fuels: this discrepancy is therefore categorized as \"statistical differences\".\n\nOur World in Data have renamed the category \"bunker fuels\" as \"International transport\" which includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. We have renamed this category for clarity.\n\nHistorical data for Australia in CDIAC from 1820 until 1860 reports negative CO2 emissions. In this dataset, pre-1860 data for Australia has been removed.\n\nData from pre-1959 is sourced from the archived Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC).
