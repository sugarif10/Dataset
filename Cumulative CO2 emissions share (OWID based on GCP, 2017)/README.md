# Cumulative CO2 emissions share (OWID based on GCP, 2017)

Cumulative carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions have been calculated by Our World in Data based on annual CO₂ emissions published by the Global Carbon Project (GCP). By summing the annual emissions to a given year we have calculated the cumulative total. 

This is given as the share of global cumulative emissions by dividing each country or region's cumulative emissions by the cumulative world emissions for that given year. 

Data converted from carbon into carbon dioxide (using conversion factor of 3.67). Data for Australia appears to be negative from 1851-1858; for clarity, these figures have been renormalised to zero.
