# Cumulative share of marriages ending in divorce (England and Wales, UK ONS)

Data represents the cumulative share of marriages in England and Wales that had ended in divorce a given number of years following the year of marriage.

Each line represents a given cohort, marked by the year in which they were married e.g. the line "1980" represents couples married in the year 1980.

The UK Office for National Statistics notes the following points:
– Cumulative percentages add a percentage from one period to the percentage of another period to show the total percentage over a given time period.

– When calculating these percentages, it has been assumed that the couples who married each year have not moved out of England and Wales, couples who divorced each year have not moved into England and Wales since getting married, and couples marry in the country where they usually live.

– The Divorce Reform Act 1969, which came into effect on 1 January 1971, made it easier for couples to divorce upon separation.
