Daily protein supply is defined as the average per capita protein availability. Note that this indicates the availability delivered to households but does not necessarily indicate the quantity of protein actually consumed (food may be wasted at the consumer level).

Data from 1961-1991 for Post-Soviet states are assumed to be in line with reported data for the USSR over this period.
