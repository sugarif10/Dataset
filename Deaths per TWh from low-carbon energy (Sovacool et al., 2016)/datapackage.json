They define an accident as: \"an unintentional incident or event at an energy facility that led to either one death (or more) or at least $50,000 in property damage.\"\n\nThis database was developed based on a series of academic databases (including ScienceDirect and EBSCO host) as well as the internet (using Google and Safari).\n\nThe normalized death rate data is presented by Sovacool et al.
