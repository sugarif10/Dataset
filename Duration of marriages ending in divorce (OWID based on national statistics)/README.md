# Duration of marriages ending in divorce (OWID based on national statistics)

This dataset combines national published estimates of marriage length: some countries present this data as the median length of marriage; others the mean length of marriage.

Due to skew in the distribution of marriage lengths, the median and mean are often notably different.

We note for each time-series whether the median or mean is used. All countries are given as a median value with the exception of Ecuador, Germany, and Sweden where this is given as the mean.

Estimates rely on multiple sources:
- For the United States, the data comes from Table 2-12 in the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsus/mgdv88_3.pdf">Vital Statistics of the United States, 1988 report</a> (1978-1988); Table 1 in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_21/sr21_038.pdf">The Duration of Marriage Before Divorce report</a> (1867 - 1977); Table 6 of the <a href="https://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/p70-97.pdf">Current Population Reports, Issued 2005</a> (2001); Table 8 of the <a href="https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/p70-125.pdf">Current Population Reports, Issued 2011</a> (2009).
