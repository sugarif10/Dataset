# Earthquake deaths (NGDC-NOAA)

Estimated number of deaths from earthquake events. This is estimated as the total number from the earthquake event plus secondary impacts (such as a tsunami triggered by an earthquake).

A significant earthquake is classified as one that meets at least one of the following criteria: caused deaths, caused moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), magnitude 7.5 or greater, Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) X or greater, or the earthquake generated a tsunami.

Our World in Data have aggregated significant earthquake deaths by country/location per year. 

Due to data availability, reporting and evidence, it's expected that more recent data will be more complete than the long historical record.
