# Economic Freedom of the World - Fraser Institute (2018)

Economic Freedom of the World is calculated by the Fraser Institute, and measures the degree to which individuals are free to choose, trade, and cooperate with others, and compete as they see fit.

The cornerstones of economic freedom are (1) personal choice, (2) voluntary exchange coordinated by markets, (3) freedom to enter and compete in markets, and (4) protection of persons and their property from aggression by others.

Individuals have economic freedom when property they acquire without the use of force, fraud, or theft is protected from physical invasions by others and they are free to use, exchange, or give their property as long as their actions do not violate the identical rights of others.
