# Emissions air pollutants over long-term (DEFRA & EPA)

Data is presented as total UK and US emissions of air pollutants from all anthropogenic/human sources measured in tonnes per year. Also provided is an index of emissions, normalised to emissions in the first year of data (1970/1980 or 1990) 1970. In other words, annual emissions in 1970 are denoted as equal to 100; values below 100 therefore indicate a fall in emissions; values above 100 indicate an increase in emissions.

PM10 and PM2.5 are used to denote emissions of particulate matter (PM) measuring less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10) and 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5).
