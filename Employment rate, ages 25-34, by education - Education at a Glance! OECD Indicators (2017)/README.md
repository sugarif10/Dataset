# Employment rate, ages 25-34, by education - Education at a Glance: OECD Indicators (2017)

The year of reference is 2016 for all countries except for: Argentina (2014), Russia (2015), Brazil (2015), Chile (2015), Ireland (2015), Indonesia (2015), South Africa (2015), and Saudi Arabia (2014). 

Data on Argentina should be used with caution. Data below 30 persons in the denominator are generally considered unreliable. Data below 5 persons in the numerator have been omitted due to confidentiality reasons. For further details on national data sources and reliability thresholds, see Table 3 in <a href="http://www.oecd.org/education/skills-beyond-school/EAG2017-Annex-3.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Annex 3: Sources, methods and technical notes</a>

Note: for the United Kingdom the OECD specifies "Data for upper secondary attainment include completion of a sufficient volume and standard of programmes that would be classified individually as completion of intermediate upper secondary programmes (16% of the adults aged 25-64 are in this group)."
