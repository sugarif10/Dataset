# Energy efficiency by passenger mode in USA (BTS)

Energy intensity of transport is measured by the US Bureau of Transport Statistics (BTS) in btu per passenger-mile. We have converted this data to kilowatt-hours per passenger-kilometer using the following conversion factors:
– BTU to kWH = 0.000293071
– mile to km = 1.60934

The US BTS notes the following about transport categories:
"Data from 2007 were calculated using a new methodology developed by FHWA. Data for these years are based on new categories and are not comparable to previous years. The new category [Small passenger vehicles] replaces the old category Passenger car and includes passenger cars, light trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles with a wheelbase (WB) equal to or less than 121 inches. The new category [Large road vehicles] replaces Other 2-axle, 4-tire vehicle and includes large passenger cars, vans, pickup trucks, and sport/utility vehicles with wheelbases (WB) larger than 121 inches. This edition of 4-20 is not comparable to those before the 2019 edition."
