Data for these years are based on new categories and are not comparable to previous years. The new category [Small passenger vehicles] replaces the old category Passenger car and includes passenger cars, light trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles with a wheelbase (WB) equal to or less than 121 inches. The new category [Large road vehicles] replaces Other 2-axle, 4-tire vehicle and includes large passenger cars, vans, pickup trucks, and sport/utility vehicles with wheelbases (WB) larger than 121 inches. This edition of 4-20 is not comparable to those before the 2019 edition.\"",
