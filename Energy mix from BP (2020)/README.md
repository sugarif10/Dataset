# Energy mix from BP (2020)

Raw data on energy consumption is sourced from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy. Available at: http://www.bp.com/statisticalreview

Primary energy in exajoules (EJ) has been converted to TWh by Our World in Data based on a conversion factor of 277.778.

Each source's share of energy based on the "substitution method" were calculated by Our World in Data by taking all energy sources' energy normalised to EJ – this takes account of the inefficiencies in fossil fuel production and is a better approximation of "final energy" consumption.

Additional metrics have been calculated by Our World in Data:
– Annual change in energy consumption by source: this is calculated as the difference from the previous year
– % of total primary energy: calculated as each source's share of primary energy from all sources
– Per capita energy by source: calculated as primary energy consumption by source, divided by population (source from the UN Population Division)
