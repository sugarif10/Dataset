# Energy mix in the UK (DUKES, 2018)

Primary energy mix in the United Kingdom by source. This is available in absolute terms of million tonnes of oil equivalents (Mtoe) and as a relative share of the total energy mix. 

Primary energy mix relates to the quantity of energy inputs to the system; thermal losses are not taken into account, meaning this does not represent the final energy share.
