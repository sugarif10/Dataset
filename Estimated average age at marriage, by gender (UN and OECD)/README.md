# Estimated average age at marriage, by gender (UN and OECD)


<strong>Definition and sources by country</strong></br>
For OECD countries, figures correspond to mean age at first marriage from the OECD Family Database. For other countries, figures correspond to Singulate Mean Age at Marriage from the UN World Marriage Data 2019.  

The Singulate Mean Age at Marriage (SMAM) is an indirect estimate of the average age at first marriage, and is calculated from survey data on marital status by age.

To calculate the SMAM, the UN World Marriage Database combines multiple sources for each country, including both census and survey estimates. For comparability, we have chosen to report only one source per country, favouring the source that provides the longest time series for each country. 

The following is a list of sources underlying our UN estimates, from most to least coverage: UNSD, DHS_STATcompiler, National Statistics, MICS, the US Census Bureau, INED, Eurostat, and IPUMS.

<strong>Further notes on Singulate Mean Age at Marriage</strong></br>
The Singulate Mean Age at Marriage is derived from the proportion of single persons of each sex in successive age groups. The main assumption involved in this computation is that change in the proportion single from age x to x+1 is a measure of the proportion of a birth cohort who married at age x. The methodology enables computation of mean age at marriage of persons (male or female) aged 15 years and above before they attain the age of 50. In other words, it provides an estimate of the average number of years lived in the never married status by those who marry before the age of 50.

<strong>OECD country series notes</strong></br>
- Estimates for Australia, New Zealand and the United States provide the median, rather than mean age at first marriage
- For Mexico, data refer to all marriages and not only first marriage
- For Canada, data include the legal union of two persons of the same sex in some provinces and territories from 2003 onwards, and in all of Canada from 2005 onwards.
- For New Zealand data include civil unions. From 2007 onwards, data include those who transferred their civil union to a marriage. 
- From 2014 onwards, data for the United Kingdom include marriages between same-sex partners.
