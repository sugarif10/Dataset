# Executions by country - Amnesty International

	Amnesty Interntional note: 
"Amnesty
International reports only on executions, death sentences and other aspects of the use of
the death penalty, such as commutations and exonerations, where there is reasonable
confirmation.
In many countries governments do not publish information on their use of the
death penalty. In Belarus, China and Viet Nam, data on the use of the death penalty is
classified as a state secret. During 2016 little or no information was available on some
countries – in particular Laos, North Korea (the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea),
Syria and Yemen – due to restrictive state practice and/or armed conflict.
Therefore, with only a few exceptions, Amnesty International’s figures on the use of the death
penalty are minimum figures.
The true figures are likely to be higher. Where the organization
obtains fuller information on a specific country in a given year this is noted in Amnesty International's report.
In 2009 Amnesty International stopped publishing its estimated figures on the use of the
death penalty in China. Amnesty International always made clear that the figures it was able
to publish on China were significantly lower than the reality, because of the restrictions on
access to information. Amnesty International’s decision to stop publishing data reflected
concerns about how the Chinese authorities misrepresented Amnesty International’s
numbers. Since 2009 the organization challenged China to publish information on the use of
the death penalty. China has yet to publish any figures on the death penalty. However,
available information indicates that thousands of people are executed and sentenced to death
in China each year."
