# Extreme precipitation in US (NOAA)

The metric of extreme single-day precipitation events measures the share of land area which experienced over a threshold percentage of precipitation in an extreme single-day burst. 

The metric of an unusually high precipitation year is measured on the basis of the standardized precipitation index (SPI). which compares actual yearly precipitation totals with the range of precipitation totals that one would typically expect at a specific location, based on historical data. If a location experiences less precipitation than normal during a particular period, it will receive a negative SPI score, while a period with more precipitation than normal will receive a positive score. The more precipitation (compared with normal), the higher the SPI score. The SPI is a useful way to look at precipitation totals because it allows comparison of different locations and different seasons on a standard scale. 

The data on unusually high precipitation shows the share of land area in the US which experienced an SPI value of 2.0 or above (well above normal) in a given year.

Nine-year smoothed average trends for these metrics are also available.
