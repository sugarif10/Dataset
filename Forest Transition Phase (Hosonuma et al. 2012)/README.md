# Forest Transition Phase (Hosonuma et al. 2012)

Low and middle-income countries are here defined by their stage in the Forest Transition.

As the source details:
"All 100 non-Annex I countries in this study were grouped into four FT phases based on two factors: percent forest cover and rate of forest area change. The four FT phases are pre-transition, early transition, late transition and post-transition, which generally represent a time sequence of national development. Pre-transition countries have high forest cover and low deforestation rates. In early-transition countries, forest cover is lost at an increasingly rapid rate. Late-transition countries with a rather small fraction of remaining forests exhibit a slowing of the deforestation rate and eventually come into the post-transition phase, where the forest area change rate becomes positive and forest cover increases through reforestation. The FT model reflects a broad-scale typology of tropical developing countries, applicable as a proxy for analyzing the temporal variability of drivers of deforestation and forest degradation."

Stage 1 = pre-transition
Stage 2 = early-transition
Stage 3 = late-transition
Stage 4 = post-transition
