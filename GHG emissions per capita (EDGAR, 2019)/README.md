# GHG emissions per capita (EDGAR, 2019)

Total greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalent are composed of CO2 totals excluding short-cycle biomass burning (such as agricultural waste burning and Savannah burning) but including other biomass burning (such as forest fires, post-burn decay, peat fires and decay of drained peatlands), all anthropogenic CH4 sources, N2O sources and F-gases (HFCs, PFCs and SF6).

Figures on per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were calculated by Our World in Data based on total GHG emissions, and population data published in the World Bank, World Development Indicators. 

The World Bank (WDI) publishes figures on annual GHG emissions by country, sourced from the European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC)/Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL). And population data sourced from the UN World Population Prospects.

Per capita GHG emissions per year was calculated by dividing total annual emissions by country by its population in the given year.

Per capita GHG emissions per day was calculated by diving annual per capita figures by 365 (and converting from tonnes to kilograms by multiplying by 1000).
