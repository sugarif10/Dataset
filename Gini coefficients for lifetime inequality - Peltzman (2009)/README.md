# Gini coefficients for lifetime inequality - Peltzman (2009)

Sent in by Sam Peltzman, who uses this data in his paper “Mortality Inequality”, Journal of Economic Perspectives 23(4), Fall 2009: 175-190.

Life tables defined by Peltzman (2009) "lists the number of survivors at each age from a hypothetical birth (age=0) cohort of 100,000." The life table data is compiled from two online databases: www.mortality.org developed by researchers at the University of California Berkeley and the Data Laboratory of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany. The http://www.lifetable.de/ data was put together by researchers from these two institutions and the researchers from the Institut national d'etudes demographiques in Paris, France.
