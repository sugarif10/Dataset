# Global Carbon Budget (GCP, 2020)

The Global Carbon Budget provides global CO2 emissions data separated into two categories:
– emissions from fossil fuels and industry (which includes coal, oil, gas, flaring, and cement production)
– land use change emissions.

Data has been converted by Our World in Data from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664.

Citations for the underlying datasets are as follows.
