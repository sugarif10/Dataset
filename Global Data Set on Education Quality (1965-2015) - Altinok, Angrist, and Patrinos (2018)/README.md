# Global Data Set on Education Quality (1965-2015) - Altinok, Angrist, and Patrinos (2018)

This dataset covers 163 countries and regions over 1965â€“2015. The globally comparable achievement outcomes were constructed by linking standardized, psychometrically-robust international and regional achievement tests, including: <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/timss/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TIMSS</a>, <a href="https://www.iea.nl/pirls" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PIRLS</a>, <a href="http://www.oecd.org/pisa/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PISA</a>, <a href="https://www.iea.nl/fims" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FIMS</a>, <a href="https://www.iea.nl/fiss" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FISS</a>, <a href="https://www.capita-sims.co.uk/products-and-services/sims-assessment" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SIMS</a>, <a href="https://ips.gu.se/english/research/research_databases/compeat/Before_1995/SISS" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SISS</a>, <a href="https://ips.gu.se/english/research/research_databases/compeat/Before_1995/Six_Subject_Survey/SSS_Reading" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SRC</a>, <a href="https://ips.gu.se/english/research/research_databases/compeat/Before_1995/RLS" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RLS</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/education/index_achievement.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MLA</a>, <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/9174/chapter/9" rel="noopener" target"_blank">IAEP</a>, <a href="http://www.sacmeq.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" >SACMEQ</a>, <a href="https://www.epdc.org/data-about-epdc-data-epdc-learning-outcomes-data/sacmeq-and-pasec" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PASEC</a>, and <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/santiago/education/education-assessment-llece/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LLECE</a>.

For the purpose of comparing outcomes, the authors construct minimum, intermediate, and advanced thresholds of educational proficiency. These thresholds are defined by level of education (primary or secondary) and by subject (maths, science, and reading). 

Primary education thresholds are defined by PIRLS and TIMSS at scores of 400 (minimum threshold) , 475 (intermediate threshold), and 625 (advanced threshold) across all subjects. Secondary education thresholds are defined using PISA at scores of roughly 400, 475, and over 600, varying by subject.  For more information on thresholds used by level of education and subject, see Table 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 in the original paper.
