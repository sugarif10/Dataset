# Global Population by Region with projections - HYDE (2016) & UN (2017)

This long-run population series by region was constructed by Our World in Data based on two key sources: the HYDE database (2016) and UN World Population Prospects (2017). 

- HYDE (2016) data is used from the year -10,000 to 1940
- UN World Population Population Prospects (2017) from 1950 to 2015; 
- Projections to 2100 from the UN World Population Population Prospects (2017)
