# Global Revenue Statistics Database - OECD (2018)

In 69 countries, the reporting year of tax revenue coincides with the calendar year, whereas 11 have different reporting years.  Where the GDP reporting year differs from the calendar year, annual GDP estimates are calculated by aggregating quarterly GDP estimates corresponding to each countryâ€™s fiscal (tax) year.
