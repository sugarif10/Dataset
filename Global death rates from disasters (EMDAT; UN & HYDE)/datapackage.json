This includes those from drought, floods, extreme weather, extreme temperature, landslides, dry mass movements, wildfires, volcanic activity and earthquakes.\n\nThe combined set of \"all natural disasters\" also includes disasters defined as \"insect infestations\", however this has not been included as a discrete dataset due to low impact numbers.\n\nUN Population figures can found at: https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\nHYDE Population figures can be found at: https://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/basicdrivingfactors/population/index-2.html",
