  "description": "Data measures global freshwater use which is the sum of water withdrawals for agriculture, industrial and domestic uses. Data from 1900-2010 is sourced from the IGB Programme (full reference below). Global data has been extended to 2014 by combining with 2014 'World' figures as reported in the World Bank - World Development Indicators, under the variable \"Annual Freshwater Withdrawals, Total (billion cubic meters)\". Available at: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators [accessed 2017-11-08].\n\nData from 1900-2010 is sourced from the IGB Database. IGB's data is estimated using the WaterGAP model from Flörke et al. 2013 (full reference below). Data is available at aggregates in OECD, BRICS and Rest of the World (ROW). OECD members are defined as countries who were members in 2010 and their membership was carried back in time. BRICS countries are Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.\n\nFull references:\nAlcamo, J., Döll, P., Henrichs, T., Kaspar, F., Lehner, B., Rösch, T., Siebert, S., 2003.
