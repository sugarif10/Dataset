# Global literacy since 1800 (OWID based on OECD & UNESCO (2019))

Global literacy series was compiled by Our World in Data from 1800 based on multiple sources. This is based on adult literacy rates (of those aged 15+ years old).

Data from 1820 to 1940 was based on estimates from the "OECD (2014) – How Was Life? – Global Well-being since 1820." Available at: https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/how-was-life_9789264214262-en. The data point for 1820 has also been assumed for the year 1800.
