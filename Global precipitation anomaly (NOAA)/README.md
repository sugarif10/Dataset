# Global precipitation anomaly (NOAA)

Data shows global precipitation patterns, based on rainfall and snowfall measurements from land-based weather stations worldwide. 

This indicator shows annual anomalies, or differences, compared with the average precipitation from 1901 to 2000. At each weather station, annual precipitation anomalies were calculated from total annual precipitation in inches. Global anomalies have been determined by dividing the world into a grid, averaging the data for each cell of the grid, and then averaging the grid cells together.
