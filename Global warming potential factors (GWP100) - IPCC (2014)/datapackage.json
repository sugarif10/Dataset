  "description": "Data denotes the global warming potential (GWP) over a 100-year timescale for greenhouse gases relative to the GWP of carbon dioxide (which is denoted as 1). Global warming potential measures the relative warming impact of one unit mass of gas relative to one unit of carbon dioxide. For example, a GWP value for gas 'x' of 25 would mean one tonne of 'x' would have 25 times the warming impact of one tonne of carbon dioixde.\n\nGWP100 values are used to convert greenhouse gases into a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) metric by multiplying emissions in mass terms by their respective GWP100 factors.\n\nIn the IPCC's 5th Assessment Report (AR5), it presents GWP both with and without climate change feedback effects. For some gases, for example methane, this can introduce significant uncertainty. In the case of methane, the GWP100 value without feedbacks is 28; with feedbacks this increases to 34. \n\nIn its official figures the IPCC adopts GWP100 factors without climate change feedbacks. Here we present the same figures without climate change feedbacks to maintain consistency with the IPCC.",
