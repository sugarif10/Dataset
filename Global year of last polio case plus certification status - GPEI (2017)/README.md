# Global year of last polio case plus certification status - GPEI (2017)

The definition of WHO Regions can be found here: http://www.who.int/about/regions/en/ 

Because the certification of being polio-free is done by the WHO by region and not by country (and only three years after the last case of polio was recorded), you see three polio statuses: endemic, polio-free (WHO Region not yet certified) and polio-free with the WHO Region of the country also certified polio-free.
