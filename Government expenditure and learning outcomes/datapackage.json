  "description": "This dataset was compiled to compare the government expenditure per primary student ($PPP) with learning outcomes. Because of the patchy nature of the government expenditure data as obtained from the World Bank EdStats Dataset, the most recent available expenditure data were used while 2006 was used as a cut-off point. \n\nThe measure of learning outcome used is the share of students either achieving or not achieving a minimum proficiency benchmark. Achievement outcomes come from standardized, psychometrically-robust international and regional tests. In order to maximize coverage by country, tests have been harmonized and pooled across subjects (math, reading, science) and levels (primary and secondary education). Higher proficiency benchmarks that represent the missing share of 100% are students that reached intermediate or advanced proficiency levels. See source for details on proficiency benchmarks. ",

See source for details on proficiency benchmarks. \n\nFor the purpose of comparing outcomes, the authors construct minimum, intermediate, and advanced thresholds of educational proficiency. These thresholds are defined by level of education (primary or secondary) and by subject (maths, science, and reading). \n\nPrimary education thresholds are defined by PIRLS and TIMSS at scores of 400 (minimum threshold) , 475 (intermediate threshold), and 625 (advanced threshold) across all subjects. Secondary education thresholds are defined using PISA at scores of roughly 400, 475, and over 600, varying by subject.
