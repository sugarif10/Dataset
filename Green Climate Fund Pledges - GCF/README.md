# Green Climate Fund Pledges - GCF

National pledges towards the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is a new global fund created to support the efforts of developing countries to respond to the challenge of climate change. GCF helps developing countries limit or reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapt to climate change.

GCF is an important part of the UNFCCC Paris climate agreement. Within the Paris Agreement advanced economies have formally agreed to jointly mobilize USD 100 billion per year by 2020.
