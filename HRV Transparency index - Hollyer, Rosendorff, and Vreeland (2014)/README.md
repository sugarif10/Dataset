# HRV Transparency index - Hollyer, Rosendorff, and Vreeland (2014)

According to the source this measure "relies on a precise and narrow conception of transparency: the disclosure of policy-relevant information by the government to the public. In addition, our measure reflects an objective view of transparency that is readily reproducible by others.

The HRV Index focuses on the availability of credible aggregate economic data. It does so by examining patterns of missing data and treating transparency as the latent term which best reflects the tendency to disclose."

The data is presented in the paper: James R. Hollyer, B. Peter Rosendorff, and James R. Vreeland, 2014 “Measuring Transparency.” Political Analysis. Vol. 22. No. 1
