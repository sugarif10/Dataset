# Hidden Hunger Index in pre-school children - Muthayya et al. (2013)

The authors note: "Hidden Hunger Index (HHI-PD) for preschool-age children is calculated as the average of three deficiency prevalence estimates: preschool children affected by stunting, anemia due to iron deficiency, and vitamin-A deficiency. The three components were equally weighted (HHI-PD score = [stunting (%) + anemia (%) + low serum retinol (%)]/3).

The HHI-PD score ranged between the best and worst possible scores of 0 and 100, respectively. Applying arbitrary cut-offs, HHI-PD scores between 0 and 19.9 were considered mild, 20-34.9 as moderate, 35-44.9 as severe, and 45-100 as alarmingly high. Highly developed countries with a 2007 Human Development Index (HDI) score above 0.9 (n=41) were assumed to have a low prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies, and were therefore excluded from this analysis.

Data on micronutrient deficiencies used in this index relate to national-level analysis and surveys over the period 1999-2009.
