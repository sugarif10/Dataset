  "description": "The Human Capital Index (HCI) combines indicators of health and education into a measure of the human capital that a child born today can expect to obtain by her 18th birthday, given the risks of poor education and health that prevail in the country where she lives. The HCI is measured in units of productivity relative to a benchmark of complete education and full health, and ranges from 0 to 1. A value of x on the HCI indicates that a child born today can expect to be only x x100 percent as productive as a future worker as she would be if she enjoyed complete education and full health. \n\nRanging between 0 and 1, the index takes the value 1 only if a child born today can expect to achieve full\nhealth (defined as no stunting and survival up to at least age 60) and complete her education potential\n(defined as 14 years of high-quality school by age 18). \n\nHCI is calculated based on the metrics of probability of survival to age 5, expected years of school, harmonized test scores, learning-adjusted years of schooling, stunting and adult survival rates.",
