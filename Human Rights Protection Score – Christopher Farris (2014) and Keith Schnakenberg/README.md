# Human Rights Protection Score â€“ Christopher Farris (2014) and Keith Schnakenberg

The original dataset includes the country ids 666.001, 666.002, and 666.003. These correspond to different human rights reports which were produced for distinct areas in Israel (Israel, pre-1967 borders Israel, occupied territories Palestinian Authority). Because of technical limitations they cannot be shown in these visualisations and shown is only the 'Israel' series.
