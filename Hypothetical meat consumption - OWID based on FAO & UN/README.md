# Hypothetical meat consumption - OWID based on FAO & UN

This is a hypothetical variable derived by Our World in Data which asks the question: "what would global meat production have to be if everyone in the world was to consume the average per capita amount of a given country?" e.g. "how much meat would we need if everyone in the world consumed the same amount of meat as the average UK citizen?".

This was derived by multiplying global population figures from the UN Population Division (2017 Revision) by per capita meat supply of a given, as published by the UN FAO.
