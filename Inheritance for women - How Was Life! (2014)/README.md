# Inheritance for women - How Was Life? (2014)

Gendered inheritance practices for immovables in 1920 are obtained from the Murdock data, while 1980 and 2000 are from the World Bank.

Information on inheritance practices at the start of the 20th century comes from George Murdock’s Ethnographic Atlas (1969).  To compare Murdock's figures to contemporary data available from the World Bank’s Fifty Years of Women’s Legal Rights database, a dichotomous scheme had to be used where 0 indicates inequality and 1 equality.
