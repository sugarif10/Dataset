# Internet Users by World Region - World Bank (2016)

I have multiplied the population in each region with the variableÂ Internet users (per 100 people). Both variables are obtianed from the World Bank. The second measure is originally from the International Telecommunication Union, World Telecommunication/ICT Development Report and database, and World Bank estimates.
