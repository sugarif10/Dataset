# Land Use Data - HYDE (2017)

The authors of the database provide the following definition clarifications for land use categories:

'Cropland' refers to the same FAO category titled 'arable land and permanent crops'.

'Grazing' refers to the FAO category titled 'permanent meadows and pastures'.

'Pastureland' refers to "Grazing land with an aridity index > 0.5, assumed to be more intensively managed".

'Rangeland' refers to "Grazing land with an aridity index > 0.5, assumed to be less or not managed".

Area values have been converted from square kilometres to hectares by multiplying by 100.
