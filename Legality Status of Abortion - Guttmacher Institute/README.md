# Legality Status of Abortion - Guttmacher Institute

Countries are grouped by abortion legality status based on four categories:
- Banned (meaning there is no explicit legal exception)
- Highly restricted (meaning abortion is illegal with some exceptions: to save the life of the mother, or in some cases preserve the health of the mother)
- Legal (but with some restrictions)
- Legal with no restrictions (apart from standard requirements such as gestation period)
