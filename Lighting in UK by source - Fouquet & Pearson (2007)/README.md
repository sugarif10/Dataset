# Lighting in UK by source - Fouquet & Pearson (2007)

Data measures the percentage of lighting in the United Kingdom by source from 1700-2000. These estimates ignore the proportion provided by fish and vegetable oil, and from indirect sources, such as cooking and heating fires.

OWID have extended the dataset from 2000 onwards, assuming electricity has maintained a 100% share of lighting sourcing.
