  "description": "Average per capita fossil fuel production - for coal, oil and gas - was calculated by OWID based on published population and national fossil fuel production data.\r\n\r\nPer capita fossil fuel production was calculated by dividing national production of coal, oil or gas by the total population in any given year.\r\n\r\nPopulation data was sourced from a combination of Gapminder sources (for data pre-1950), and from 1950 onwards was sourced from the UN Population Division's 2017 Revision.\r\n\r\nFossil fuel production data was sourced from a combination of sources.\r\n\r\nGlobal data from 1800-1965 was sourced from Vaclav Smil's Updated and Revised Edition of his book, 'Energy Transitions: Global and National Perspectives' (2017). This book can be found on Smil's website at: http://vaclavsmil.com/2016/12/14/energy-transitions-global-and-national-perspectives-second-expanded-and-updated-edition/.\r\n\r\nGlobal data from 1965 onwards was sourced from BP Statistical Review of Global Energy.
