# MDG Final Evaluation (UN MDG Report)

Data is based on the UN's final evaluation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and sourced from its final report (http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/2015_MDG_Report/pdf/MDG%202015%20rev%20(July%201).pdf) and Statistical Database (http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Resources/Static/Products/Progress2015/StatAnnex.pdf).
