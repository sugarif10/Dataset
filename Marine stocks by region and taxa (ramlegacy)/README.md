# Marine stocks by region and taxa (ramlegacy)

This dataset provides aggregated data on fish biomass, fishing pressure and catch by region and taxa, based on the results of the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database: https://www.ramlegacy.org/

This aggregated data was provided by Michael Melnychuk, researcher on the RAM Legacy Database.

These results were published in PNAS here:

Definitions are as follows:
– 'Biomass' is a measure of biomass of fish divided by the biomass of fish at the maximum sustainable yield (B / Bmsy)
– 'Fishing pressure' is a measure of fishing pressure divided by the pressure at the maximum sustainable yield (U / Umsy)
– 'Catch' is a measure of the annual catch divided by the mean catch across the stock's time series
