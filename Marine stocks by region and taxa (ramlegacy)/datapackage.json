Available at: https://www.pnas.org/content/117/4/2218\n\nDefinitions are as follows:\n– 'Biomass' is a measure of biomass of fish divided by the biomass of fish at the maximum sustainable yield (B / Bmsy)\n– 'Fishing pressure' is a measure of fishing pressure divided by the pressure at the maximum sustainable yield (U / Umsy)\n– 'Catch' is a measure of the annual catch divided by the mean catch across the stock's time series",
