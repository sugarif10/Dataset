Gapminder has reconstructed the historical data for the following 13 countries: Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Sri Lanka, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 

The original source of the World Bank data is: WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group, and the United Nations Population Division. Trends in Maternal Mortality: 1990 to 2015. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2015 

The two datasets were combined without any adjustments.
