  "description": "Data was calculated by Our World in Data based on business-as-usual extrapolations of historical trends published by the World Bank.\n\nThe World Bank's World Development Indicators, available at: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/indicators. Data was downloaded on 30th August 2018.\n\nMaternal mortality ratio is the number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes while pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination per 100,000 live births. The data are estimated with a regression model using information on the proportion of maternal deaths among non-AIDS deaths in women ages 15-49, fertility, birth attendants, and GDP.\n\nThe World Bank's source data is derived from: WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group, and the United Nations Population Division. Trends in Maternal Mortality: 1990 to 2015. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2015.\n\nOur future figures, extending from 2015 to 2030 were estimated assuming a 'business-as-usual' continuation of average progress in the latest 10 years of maternal mortality data (2005-2015). Here we calculated the average annual change over this period, and applied it from 2015 onwards to derive estimates by 2030. \n\nNote that these figures therefore do not represent a forecast or prediction, but simply represent expected change if progress continues at recent rates.",
