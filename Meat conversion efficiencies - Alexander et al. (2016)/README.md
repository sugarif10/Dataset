# Meat conversion efficiencies - Alexander et al. (2016)

Livestock conversion efficiencies are given as reported in Alexander et al. (2016). Alexander, P., Brown, C., Arneth, A., Finnigan, J., & Rounsevell, M. D. (2016). Human appropriation of land for food: the role of diet. Global Environmental Change, 41, 88-98.

'Feed conversion ratio' is defined as the quantity of feed inputs required to produce one kilogram of edible product. This is measured in kilograms of dry-matter feed per kilogram of edible weight product.

Protein and energy efficiency are both measured as the percentage of protein or energy converted from feed to animal product.
