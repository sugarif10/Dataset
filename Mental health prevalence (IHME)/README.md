It is differentiated from INCIDENCE, which refers to the number of new cases in the population at a given time."

The variable 'depressive disorders' refers to the sum of those suffering from 'major depressive disorder' and 'persistent depressive disorder'.

"Drug dependence is defined by the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) as the presence of three or more indicators of dependence for at least a month within the previous year. These indicators consist of a strong desire to take the substance, impaired control over use, a withdrawal syndrome on ceasing or reducing use, tolerance to the effects of the drug, the need for larger doses to achieve the desired psychological effect, a disproportionate amount of time spent by the user obtaining, using, and recovering from drug use, and persistence of drug taking despite the problems that occur.
