# Mental health services across incomes - Wang et al. (2007)

Data is available only for a small number of countries, and based on household surveys over the period 2001-2004.

'Share receiving any treatment for mental health' refers to the percentage of total respondents (with or without mental health burden) who received any form of treatment in the last 12 months.

In differentiating the share of people with particular severities of mental illness receiving treatment, the authors define the following categories:
- 'Severe' = "bipolar I disorder or substance dependence with a physiological dependence syndrome, making a suicide attempt in conjunction with any other disorder, reporting severe role impairment due to a mental disorder in at least two areas of functioning measured by disorder-specific Sheehan Disability Scales (SDS),12 or having overall functional impairment from any disorder consistent with a Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF)13 score of 50 or less."

- 'Moderate' = "substance dependence without a physiological dependence syndrome or at least moderate interference in any SDS domain"

- 'Mild' = all other disorders not noted above.

Mental health services were classified into the following sectors: 
- mental health specialty (psychiatrist, psychologist, other mental health professional in any setting, social worker or counsellor in a mental health specialty setting, use of a mental health hotline); 
- general medical (primary care doctor, other general medical doctor, nurse, any other health professional not previously mentioned); 
- human services (religious or spiritual advisor, social worker, or counsellor in any setting other than a specialty mental health setting);
- complementary and alternative medicine (any other type of healer such as chiropractors, participation in an internet support group, participation in a self-help group).
