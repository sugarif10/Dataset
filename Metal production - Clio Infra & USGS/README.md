# Metal production - Clio Infra & USGS

Data on metal production is based on the combination of two sources.

Historical data from 1850-2011 is sourced from the ClioInfra database, available at: https://www.clio-infra.eu/ [accessed 9th September 2017].

This has been combined with recent data from the USGS Mineral Statistics from 2012 onwards. Available at: https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/aluminum/ [accessed 9th September 2017].

Both sources report primary production in thousand metric tonnes.
Note: Gold production is measured in metric tons.
