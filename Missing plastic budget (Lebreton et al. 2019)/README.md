# Missing plastic budget (Lebreton et al. 2019)

Data describes modelled and projected ocean plastic under three 'plastic emissions' scenarios.

Given is the modelled global accumulation of buoyant macroplastics (>0.5 cm) in the ocean. And the accumulation of microplastics (<0.5 cm), which is degraded plastic material from the ocean surface layer.

This is given under three scenarios:
(1) Emissions of plastic to the world's oceans stopped by 2020;
(2) Emissions stagnated at 2020 levels;
(3) Increasing emissions of plastic until 2050 in line with the average growth rate of global plastic production from 2005-2015.
