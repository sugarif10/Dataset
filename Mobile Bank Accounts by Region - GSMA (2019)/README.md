# Mobile Bank Accounts by Region - GSMA (2019)

GSMA's definition of mobile money services:
- A mobile money service includes transferring money and making payments using the mobile phone.

- The service must be available to the unbanked, e.g. people who do not have access to a formal account at a financial institution.

- The service must offer a network of physical transactional points which can include agents, outside of bank branches and ATMs, that make the service widely accessible to everyone.

- Mobile banking or payment services (such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet) that offer the mobile phone as just another channel to access a traditional banking product are not included.

Data refers to the cumulative number of customer accounts at the end the year indicated. Customers who have not been registered but perform transactions over the counter are NOT included.

Global data are is available from 2006-2018. Regional data are not available before 2012, due to confidentiality restriction with the survey participants. However, 2006 data for Sub-Saharan Africa are available as published in GSMA, The State of Mobile Money in Sub-Saharan Africa 2016.
