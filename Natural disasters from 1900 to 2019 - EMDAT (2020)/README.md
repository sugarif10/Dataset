The data presented here includes all categories classified as "natural disasters" (distinguished from technological disasters, such as oil spills and industrial accidents). This includes those from drought, floods, extreme weather, extreme temperature, landslides, dry mass movements, wildfires, volcanic activity and earthquakes.

emdat defines the following variables as:

Affected: "People requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency, i.e. requiring basic survival needs such as food, water, shelter, sanitation and immediate medical assistance."

Injured: "People suffering from physical injuries, trauma or an illness requiring immediate medical assistance as a direct result of a disaster."

Homeless: "Number of people whose house is destroyed or heavily damaged and therefore need shelter after an event."

Total affected: "In EM-DAT, it is the sum of the injured, affected and left homeless after a disaster."

Estimated economic damage: "The amount of damage to property, crops, and livestock. In EM-DAT estimated damage are given in US$ (â€˜000). For each disaster, the registered figure corresponds to the damage value at the moment of the event, i.e. the figures are shown true to the year of the event."

Total deaths: "In EM-DAT, it is the sum of deaths and missing."
