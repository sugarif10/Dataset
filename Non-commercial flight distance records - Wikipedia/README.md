# Non-commercial flight distance records - Wikipedia

This data has been sourced from the compilation of flight distance records Wiki available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_distance_record [accessed 2017-07-11]. References to the individual sources for each record can be found at this link.

Only non-commercial powered aircraft are included in this dataset, which contains only those flights taken without mid-flight refueling.

Where more than one record was set in any given year, only the highest of the given year has been included here.
