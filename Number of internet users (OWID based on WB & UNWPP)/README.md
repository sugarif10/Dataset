# Number of internet users (OWID based on WB & UNWPP)

The number of internet users is calculated by Our World in Data based on internet access figures as a share of the total population, published in the World Bank, World Development Indicators (http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators) and total population figures from the UN World Population Prospects (2017) (https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/).

The World Bank defines internet users as: "Internet users are individuals who have used the Internet (from any location) in the last 3 months. The Internet can be used via a computer, mobile phone, personal digital assistant, games machine, digital TV etc."
