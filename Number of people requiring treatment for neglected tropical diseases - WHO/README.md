# Number of people requiring treatment for neglected tropical diseases - WHO

This variable is defined as: "Number of people requiring treatment and care for any one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)
targeted by the WHO NTD Roadmap and World Health Assembly resolutions and reported to WHO."

The UN notes: "This number should not be interpreted as the number of people at risk for NTDs. It is in fact a subset of
the larger number of people at risk. Mass treatment is limited to those living in districts above a threshold level of prevalence; it does not include all people living in districts with any risk of infection. Individual treatment and care is for those who are or have already been infected; it does not include all contacts and others at risk of infection. This number can better be interpreted as the number of people at a level of risk requiring medical intervention â€“ that is, treatment and care for NTDs."
