# Number with and without access to clean cooking fuels (OWID based on WB, 2019)

Absolute numbers of people with and without access to clean cooking fuels was calculated by Our World in Data based on original data sourced from the World Bank's World Development Indicators: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators

Our World in Data calculated absolute numbers based on original data on the share of the population with access to clean fuels for cooking, and the total population numbers.

– Number of people with access to clean cooking fuels = [population / 100 * % access to clean fuels]
– Number of people with access to clean cooking fuels = [population - number of people with access]

Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking is the proportion of total population primarily using clean cooking fuels and technologies for cooking. Under WHO guidelines, kerosene is excluded from clean cooking fuels.
