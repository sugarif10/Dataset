  "description": "For each year 1900–2018, the V-Dem Project (v9, 2019), variable \"Regimes of the world – the RoW measure (D) (v2x_regime)\", classifies each country as one of four possible regimes:\n\n0. Closed autocracy\n1. Electoral autocracy\n2. Electoral democracy\n3. Liberal democracy\n\nThe V-Dem Project makes these classifications based on a number of other measures. For details, see p. 254 of their \"V-Dem Cookbook v9\".\n\nThe dataset \"Numbers and Shares of Each Political Regime — V-Dem (2019)\" was produced entirely from the above classification and contains 13 variables. These variables simply count, for each year 1900–2018, the number and share of each of the four regimes and combinations thereof.\n\nFor how this dataset was produced, see this document: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_Xbbxiw-nbSv1dSWHZK36ttsNb7DmuG8.",
