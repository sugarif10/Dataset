# Ozone and chlorine projections to 2100 (Scientific Assessment 2014)

Figures represent stratospheric ozone, and effective stratospheric chlorine (ESC) based on historical measurement and future projections from chemistry-climate models.

Chemistry-climate models are used to make projections of total ozone amounts that account for the effects of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and climate change. Regional and global projections are shown for total ozone and ESC for the period
1960â€“2100, referenced to 1960 values (i.e. 1960 = 0).

Data is based on those in Q20-2 in 'Twenty questions and answers about the ozone layer: 2014 update', published as the 2014 edition of the Scientific Assessment Panel of the Montreal Protocol.

Data was extracted from the static figure, Q0-1, using the extraction tool WebPlotDigitizer (https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/).
