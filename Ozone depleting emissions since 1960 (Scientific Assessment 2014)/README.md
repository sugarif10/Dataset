# Ozone depleting emissions since 1960 (Scientific Assessment 2014)

Figures represent emissions of ozone-depleting substances, with substances weighted by their potential to destroy ozone (their ozone-depleting potential). This gives a total value of emissions normalised to their CFC11-equivalents. 

Total emissions is inclusive of naturally-occurring and man-made emissions.

Data is based on those in Q0-1 in 'Twenty questions and answers about the ozone layer: 2014 update', published as the 2014 edition of the Scientific Assessment Panel of the Montreal Protocol.

Data was extracted from the static figure, Q0-1, using the extraction tool WebPlotDigitizer (https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/).
