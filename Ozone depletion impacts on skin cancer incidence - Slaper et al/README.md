# Ozone depletion impacts on skin cancer incidence - Slaper et al.

The authors modelled the number of excess skin cancer cases they would expect among fair-skinned populations in the United States and Northwest Europe as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion.

This was modelled for a scenario of no restrictions on ozone-depleting substances, where the authors assumed a 3% annual increase in emissions of chloroflourocarbons (CFCs), halons and methyl chloroforms. 

The Montreal Protocol scenario assumed a decline of five important ozone-depleting substances by 50% by the end of 1999 as agreed in the protocol in 1987.

The Copenhagen Amendment assumed the production of 21 ozone-depleting substances reduced to zero by the end of 1995.
