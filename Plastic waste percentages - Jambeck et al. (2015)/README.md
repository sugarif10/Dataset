# Plastic waste percentages - Jambeck et al. (2015)

Jambeck et al. quantified municipal and plastic waste streams from coastal populations in 2010 with projections to the year 2025.

The authors define mismanaged and inadequately managed waste as follows: "mismanaged waste is material that is either littered or inadequately disposed. Inadequately disposed waste is not formally managed and includes disposal in dumps or open, uncontrolled landfills, where it is not fully contained. Mismanaged waste could eventually enter the ocean via inland waterways, wastewater outflows, and transport by wind or tides. "
