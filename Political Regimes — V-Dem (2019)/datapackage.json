  "description": "For each year 1900–2018, the V-Dem Project (v9, 2019), variable \"Regimes of the world – the RoW measure (D) (v2x_regime)\", classifies each country as one of four possible regimes:\n\n0. Closed autocracy\n1. Electoral autocracy\n2. Electoral democracy\n3. Liberal democracy\n\nThe V-Dem Project makes these classifications based on a number of other measures. For details, see p. 254 of their \"V-Dem Cookbook v9\".\n\nThe dataset \"Political Regimes — V-Dem (2019)\" simply reproduces this v2x_regime classification. (For how this dataset was produced, see: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eFZmRChBFmeAXLx0tQ965YOHlXe6WQH_.)\n\n---\n\nHere follow some notes on several peculiar \"countries\" that appear on the V-Dem Project dataset.\n\nFirst, there are three separate Palestines, namely:\n\n- \"Palestine/British Mandate\"  (v2x_regime coding available for the years 1914–48): coded as 0 (closed autocracy) every year.\n- \"Palestine/Gaza\" (1948–66 and 2007–18): 0 every year.\n- \"Palestine/West Bank\" (1948–49 and 2003–18): 0 in 1948–49, 2008–12, and 2015–18; 1 in all other years.\n\nWe at OWID have decided to drop Palestine/British Mandate for 1948.\n\nSecond, there are Somalia and Somaliland:\n\n- Somaliland (1900–2018): Coded as 0 in 1900–2002; 1 in 2003–09 and 2013–18; and 2 in 2010–12.\n- Somalia (1900–2018): 1 in 1956–69 and 1980–83; 0 in all other years.\n\nThus, in this dataset, \"Somalia\" excludes Somaliland.\n\nThird, there are Tanzania and Zanzibar:\n\n- Zanzibar (1905–2018): 0 in 1905–94 and 1 in 1995–2018 = 1. \n- Tanzania (1915–2018): 0 in 1915–61, 1 in 1962–94, 2 in 1995–2000, 1 in 2001–07, 2 in 2008, 1 in 2009, 2 in 2010–15, 1 in 2016–17, 2 in 2018.\n\nThus, in this dataset, \"Tanzania\" excludes Zanzibar.\n\nFourth, for 1990 and before, \"Yemen\" refers to North Yemen. There are separate data for \"South Yemen\" for the years 1900–90.",
