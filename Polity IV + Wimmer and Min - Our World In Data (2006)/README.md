# Polity IV + Wimmer and Min - Our World In Data (2006)

The original data provides information on each territory's colonial power. To be able to combine this with the numerical Polity2 metric I coded colonized countries as -20. If a country was coded as a colony in the Wimmer and Min data and had a value in the Polity 2 data set then I preferred the Polity 2 measure and this is shown in the final data set.
