# Public support and opposition to nuclear energy- Ipsos MORI (2011)

The Ipsos MORI survey was conducted in 24 countries. An international sample of 18,787 adults aged 18-64 in the US and Canada, and age 16-64 in all other countries, were interviewed between May 6 and May 21, 2011 via the Ipsos Online Panel system.

Results presented here are in response to the question: "Please indicate whether you strongly support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose each way of producing electricity" [results for nuclear electricity production].

Four responses were accepted for this question: "strongly support"; "somewhat support"; "somewhat oppose"; and "strongly oppose". We have simplified these results to "support" and "oppose" by summing the former and latter two responses, respectively.
