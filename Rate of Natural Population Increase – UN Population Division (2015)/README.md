# Rate of Natural Population Increase â€“ UN Population Division (2015)

The Rate of Natural Population Increase is the crude birth rate minus the crude death rate. Represents the portion of population growth (or decline) determined exclusively by births and deaths.

 The data refers to the 5 year interval preceding the shown year (e.g. 1955 is '1950 to 1955')

In the original dataset it is expressed per 1,000 population annually. Here it is expressed in percentage terms (original value divided by 10).
