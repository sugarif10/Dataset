# Rate of internationally observed elections - Hyde and Marinov (2012)

Codebook notes:
" The National Elections across Democracy and Autocracy (NELDA) dataset provides detailed information on all election events from 1945-2012. To be included, elections must be for a national executive figure, such as a president, or for a national legislative body, such as a parliament, legislature, constituent assembly, or other directly elected representative bodies. In order for an election to be included, voters must directly elect the person or persons appearing on the ballot to the national post in question.

Elections may or may not be competitive, and may have any number of other ostensible flaws. In fact, the inclusion of flawed elections is a feature of the NELDA dataset. "

The unit of observation is the NELDA dataset is the election round. The ElectionID variable has been used to collapse multi-round elections into one observation for OWIDâ€™s purposes. In three election events, Equatorial Guinea's 1993 legislative/parliamentary election, Equatorial Guinea's 1996 presidential/other direct executive election, and Zimbabwe's 2005 legislative/parliamentary election, these election events were coded as unobserved by Western monitors, yet criticized with allegations of significant vote-fraud. For our purposes, these three election events have been re-coded as unobserved and not criticized as no Western monitors were in the country at the time to monitor the election.

The percent of observed and criticized elections was calculated as:

% observed and criticized elections = (no.of criticized elections/ total no. of elections) * 100

The percent of observed and not criticized elections was calculated as:

% observed and not criticized elections = [(no. of observed elections - no. of criticized elections)/total number of elections] * 100

Microstates, defined as those countries with less than 500,000 citizens at the time of election, have been excluded. Five independent states that did not hold any direct elections between 1945-2012 - China, Eritrea, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates - have also been excluded.
