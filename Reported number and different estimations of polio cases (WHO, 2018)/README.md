# Reported number and different estimations of polio cases (WHO, 2018)

For the estimated number of polio cases using Tebbens et al.’s 2010 model:
The WHO’s dataset of reported polio cases from 1980 onwards (the first link above) is used to produce an estimate of the actual number of polio cases. An explanation of the correction factor algorithm can be found here: https://ourworldindata.org/tebbens-et-al-2011-estimation-of-the-number-of-paralytic-polio-cases/ Part of the model input consists of the WHO’s surveillance system that can be found under the second link cited above. 


For the estimated number of polio cases that disregard any reported cases after a country was certified polio-free and use Tebbens et al.’s (2010) model: 
The WHO’s dataset from 1980 onwards (the first link above) was modified by deleting all documented polio cases after the year in which polio ceased to be endemic in each country (see map and data here: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-decade-of-the-last-recorded-case-of-paralytic-polio-by-country). Then, Tebbens et al.’s  (2010) model is applied in the same way as for the “Estimated number of polio cases”, for which we provide an explanation here: https://ourworldindata.org/tebbens-et-al-2011-estimation-of-the-number-of-paralytic-polio-cases/.
