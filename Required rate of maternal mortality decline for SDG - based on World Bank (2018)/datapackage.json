  "description": "Data was calculated by Our World in Data based on 2015 estimates of maternal mortality published by the World Bank, and UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 3.1.\n\nThe World Bank's World Development Indicators, available at: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/indicators. Data was downloaded on 30th August 2018.\n\nMaternal mortality ratio is the number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes while pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination per 100,000 live births. The data are estimated with a regression model using information on the proportion of maternal deaths among non-AIDS deaths in women ages 15-49, fertility, birth attendants, and GDP.\n\nThe World Bank's source data is derived from: WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group, and the United Nations Population Division. Trends in Maternal Mortality: 1990 to 2015. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2015.\n\nHere we calculate the average annual rate of decline required for each country to attain a maternal mortality ratio as low as 70 per 100,000 live births over the period 2015 to 2030. Data for countries with maternal mortality rates already below 70 per 100,000 (in 2015) are not included.\n\nNote that these figures therefore do not represent a forecast or prediction, but simply represent required rates of progress to attain a maternal mortality ratio as low as 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.",
