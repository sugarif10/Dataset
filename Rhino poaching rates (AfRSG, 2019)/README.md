# Rhino poaching rates (AfRSG, 2019)

Estimates of rhino poaching numbers and rates are collected and published periodically by the African and Asian Rhino Specialist Groups and TRAFFIC groups.

Data on the number of rhinos poached is annual, where available. Rhino horn seizures data is the total over the period from 2009 to September 2018.

The majority of figures on number of rhinos poached, and seizures are sourced from:

Emslie, R.H. et al., 2019. African and Asian rhinoceroses - status, conservation and trade. A report from the IUCN Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC) African and Asian Rhino Specialist Groups and TRAFFIC to the CITES Secretariat pursuant to Resolution Conf. 9.14 (Rev. CoP17).
