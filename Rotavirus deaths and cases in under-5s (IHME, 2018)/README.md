# Rotavirus deaths and cases in under-5s (IHME, 2018)

Data is the summary of research published by Troeger et al. (2018) based on statistics from the IHME, Global Burden of Disease study.

Data presents the estimated number of child (under five years old) deaths; child mortality rate; and number of cases from rotavirus. Also given is the estimated number of deaths averted from the rotavirus vaccine, and potential avertable deaths if full rotavirus vaccine coverage was achieved.

Rotavirus is a diarrheal disease responsible for an estimated 29% of diarrheal disease deaths in children under five years old.

Estimates of potentially avertable deaths from the rotavirus vaccine take into consideration its efficacy in different regions: whilst efficacy in children in high-income countries is typically greater than 90%, in lower-income countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, this efficacy rate is closer to 50%.
