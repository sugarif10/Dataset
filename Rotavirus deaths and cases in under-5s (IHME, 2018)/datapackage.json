(2018) based on statistics from the IHME, Global Burden of Disease study.\n\nData presents the estimated number of child (under five years old) deaths; child mortality rate; and number of cases from rotavirus. Also given is the estimated number of deaths averted from the rotavirus vaccine, and potential avertable deaths if full rotavirus vaccine coverage was achieved.\n\nRotavirus is a diarrheal disease responsible for an estimated 29% of diarrheal disease deaths in children under five years old.\n\nEstimates of potentially avertable deaths from the rotavirus vaccine take into consideration its efficacy in different regions: whilst efficacy in children in high-income countries is typically greater than 90%, in lower-income countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, this efficacy rate is closer to 50%.",
