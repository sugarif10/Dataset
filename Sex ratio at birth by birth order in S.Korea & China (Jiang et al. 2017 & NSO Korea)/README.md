# Sex ratio at birth by birth order in S.Korea & China (Jiang et al. 2017 & NSO Korea)

Data measures the sex ratio at birth (SRB) depending on the birth order of children (first, second, third-born or fourth-born and higher children). SRB is measured as the number of male births per 100 female births. The natural 'sex ratio at birth' is noted to be 105 male births per 100 female births.
