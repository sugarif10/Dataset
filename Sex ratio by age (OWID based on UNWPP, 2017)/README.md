# Sex ratio by age (OWID based on UNWPP, 2017)

Sex ratio is here defined as the number of males per 100 females. Data is given at different life stages: one-year olds, 5-year olds, 10-year olds, 15-year olds, 20-year olds and each decade thereafter (to 100 year olds).

This was calculated by Our World in Data based on male and female population estimates published in the United Nations World Population Prospects (2017 Revision).
