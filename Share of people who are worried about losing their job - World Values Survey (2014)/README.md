# Share of people who are worried about losing their job - World Values Survey (2014)

Share of people who say they worry 'very much' or 'a great deal' in answer to the question "To what degree are you worried about the following situations? Losing my job or not finding a job". Possible answers include 'Very much', 'A great deal', 'Not much', 'Not at all', and 'No answer'. Our estimates exclude those with no answer given. 

The methodology followed for constructing the variable is as follows:
<ul>
<li>Created a dichotomous worry preference variable, combining responses of people who say they worry 'very much' or 'a great deal' and those who answered 'Not much' or 'Not at all', where 1=worry and 0=do not worry</li>
<li>Generated a variable for the number of respondents in each country, by survey year </li>
<li>Summed to give the total number of people who worry 'very much' or 'a great deal' with the above question and the total number of surveyed responses, for each country in each year </li>
<li>Calculated the % of respondents who worry about losing or finding a job = (number of people who worry very much or a great deal / number of respondents) * 100 </li>
</ul>

The number of survey respondents varies from country-to-country and year-to-year. Therefore, comparisons across countries should be made with caution. WVS data to this question is only available for the latest wave. Surveys have been conducted across countries in different years. See the WVS documentation for further information for the year in which Wave 6 of the WVS was carried out.
