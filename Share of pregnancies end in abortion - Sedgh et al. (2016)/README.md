# Share of pregnancies end in abortion - Sedgh et al. (2016)

Estimated share of pregnancies that end in abortion. This data was derived by the authors using estimates of the incidence of abortions, and pregnancy rates at global, regional and sub-regional levels over the period 1990-2014. 

The total number of pregnancies is the sum of all livebirths, abortions, and miscarriages (spontaneous fetal losses at 5 or more weeks of gestation). 

The authors used abortion data from government agencies and compiled data from international sources and nationally representative studies to produce global and regional estimates. Utilising data for 1069 country-years, abortion incidence was estimated using a Bayesian hierarchical time series model whereby the overall abortion rate is a function of the modelled rates in subgroups of women of reproductive age.

Data was reported over the period 1990-2014 in five-year intervals. Here we allocate the given data point to the final year of the five-year interval: i.e. "1994" denotes the period 1990-1994; "1999" denotes 1995-1999; [...], "2014" denotes 2010-2014.
