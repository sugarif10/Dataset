# Share of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion - Bearak et al. (2018)

Estimated share of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion was derived by the authors based on global, regional and sub-regional estimates of unintended pregnancy rates and abortion incidence over the period 1990-2014. This is measured as the percentage of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion amongst women of reproductive age (15-44 years old). 

The authors used abortion data from government agencies and compiled data from international sources and nationally representative studies to produce global and regional estimates. Utilising data for 1069 country-years, incidence was estimated using a Bayesian hierarchical time series model whereby the overall abortion rate is a function of the modelled rates in subgroups of women of reproductive age.

To estimate the unintended pregnancy rate, the authors "used a Bayesian hierarchical time series model in which the dependent variable was the number of unintended pregnancies among all women of reproductive age in a given country and year. The predictors were the numbers of women of reproductive age in each of the three subgroups of women (married women with an unmet need, married women experiencing failure with a contraceptive method, and all unmarried women)." This is measured as the number of unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women of reproductive age (15-44 years old).

Data was reported over the period 1990-2014 in five-year intervals. Here we allocate the given data point to the final year of the five-year interval: i.e. "1994" denotes the period 1990-1994; "1999" denotes 1995-1999; [...], "2014" denotes 2010-2014.
