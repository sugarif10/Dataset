# Significant earthquake events (NGDC-NASA)

The Significant Earthquake Database is a global listing of over 5,700 earthquakes from 2150 BC to the present. A significant earthquake is classified as one that meets at least one of the following criteria: caused deaths, caused moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), magnitude 7.5 or greater, Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) X or greater, or the earthquake generated a tsunami.

Our World in Data have aggregated significant earthquake numbers by country/location per year. 

Due to data availability, reporting and evidence, it's expected that more recent data will be more complete than the long historical record.
