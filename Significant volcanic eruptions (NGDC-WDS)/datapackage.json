A significant eruption is classified as one that meets at least one of the following criteria: caused fatalities, caused moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), with a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 6 or larger, caused a tsunami, or was associated with a major earthquake.\n\nNote that since this data is very long-term it's expected that most recent data on eruptions will be the most complete than long historic events.",
