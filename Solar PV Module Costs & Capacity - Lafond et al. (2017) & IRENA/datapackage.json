The authors sourced this data from the Navigant Research series (https://www.navigantresearch.com/).\n\nOur World in Data have extended this series up to 2019 based on the latest data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Resource, which reports global solar PV installed capacity and solar PV model prices. Available at: http://resourceirena.irena.org/gateway/dashboard/\nhttps://www.irena.org/publications/2020/Jun/Renewable-Power-Costs-in-2019\n\nIRENA presents solar PV module price series for a number of different module technologies. Here we have adopted the series for Thin film a-Si/u-Si, which it adopts as the Global Index.\n\nPrices from LaFond et al.
