# Suicide rates by sex and age (IHME, 2019)

Death rates from suicide are measured as the number of suicide deaths measured per 100,000 individuals in a given demographic group.

The male-female suicide ratio is calculated by Our World in Data by dividing the male age-standardized suicide rate by the female age-standardized rate.
