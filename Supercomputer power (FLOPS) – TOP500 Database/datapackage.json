  "description": "Data on supercomputer power is sourced from the TOP500 database, which tracks and reports the 500 largest supercomputers on a bi-annual basis. \n\nSupercomputer power is measured in Floating-Point Operations per Second (FLOPS), a measure of calculations per second for floating-point operations. Floating-point operations are needed for very large or very small real numbers, or computations that require a large dynamic range. It is therefore a more accurate measured than simply instructions per second.",
