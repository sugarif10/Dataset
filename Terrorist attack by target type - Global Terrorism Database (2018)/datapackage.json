  "description": "As explained by the Global Terrorism Database (https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf):\n\nData denotes the general type of target/victim. When a victim is attacked specifically because of his or her relationship to a particular person, such as a prominent figure, the target type reflects that motive. For\nexample, if a family member of a government official is attacked because of his or her relationship to that individual, the type of target is “government.” \n\nThis variable consists of the following 22 categories:\n1 = BUSINESS\nBusinesses are defined as individuals or organizations engaged in commercial or mercantile activity as a means of livelihood. Any attack on a business or private citizens patronizing a business such as a restaurant, gas station, music store, bar, café, etc. This includes attacks carried out against corporate offices or employees of firms like mining companies, or oil corporations. Furthermore, includes attacks conducted on business people or corporate officers. Included in this value as well are hospitals and chambers of commerce and cooperatives. Does not include attacks carried out in public or quasi-public areas such as “business district or commercial area”, or generic business-related individuals such as\n“businessmen” (these attacks are captured under “Private Citizens and Property”, see below.) Also does not include attacks against generic business-related individuals such as “businessmen.” Unless the victims were targeted because of their specific business affiliation, these attacks belong in “Private Citizens and Property.”\n\n2 = GOVERNMENT (GENERAL)\nAny attack on a government building; government member, former members, including members of political parties in official capacities, their convoys, or events sponsored by political parties; political movements; or a government sponsored institution where the attack is expressly carried out to harm the government. This value includes attacks on judges, public attorneys (e.g., prosecutors), courts and court systems, politicians, royalty, head of state, government employees (unless police or military), election-related attacks, or intelligence agencies and spies. This value does not include attacks on political candidates for office or members of political parties that do not hold an elected office (these attacks are captured in “Private Citizens and Property”).\n\n3 = POLICE\nThis value includes attacks on members of the police force or police installations; this includes police boxes, patrols headquarters, academies, cars, checkpoints, etc. Includes attacks against jails or prison facilities, or jail or prison staff or guards.\n\n4 = MILITARY\nIncludes attacks against military units, patrols, barracks, convoys, jeeps, and aircraft. Also includes attacks on recruiting sites, and soldiers engaged in internal policing functions such as at checkpoints and in anti narcotics activities. This category also includes peacekeeping units that conduct military operations (e.g., AMISOM). Excludes attacks against non-state militias and guerrillas, these types of attacks are coded as “Terrorist/Non-state Militias” see below.\n\n5 = ABORTION RELATED\nAttacks on abortion clinics, employees, patrons, or security personnel stationed at clinics.\n\n6 = AIRPORTS & AIRCRAFT\nAn attack that was carried out either against an aircraft or against an airport. Attacks against airline employees while on board are also included in this value. Includes attacks conducted against airport business offices and executives. Military aircraft are not included.\n\n7 = GOVERNMENT (DIPLOMATIC)\nAttacks carried out against foreign missions, including embassies, consulates, etc. This value includes cultural centers that have diplomatic functions, and attacks against diplomatic staff and their families (when the relationship is relevant to the motive of the attack) and property. The United Nations is a diplomatic target.\n\n8 = EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION\nAttacks against schools, teachers, or guards protecting school sites. Includes attacks against university professors, teaching staff and school buses. Moreover, includes attacks against religious schools in this value. As noted below in the “Private Citizens and Property” value, the GTD has several attacks against students. If attacks involving students are not expressly against a school, university or other educational institution or are carried out in an educational setting, they are coded as private citizens and property. Excludes attacks against military schools (attacks on military schools are coded as “Military,” see below).\n\n9 = FOOD OR WATER SUPPLY\nAttacks on food or water supplies or reserves are included in this value. This generally includes attacks aimed at the infrastructure related to food and water for human consumption.\n\n10 = JOURNALISTS & MEDIA\nIncludes, attacks on reporters, news assistants, photographers, publishers, as well as attacks on media headquarters and offices. Attacks on transmission facilities such as antennae or transmission towers, or broadcast infrastructure are coded as “Telecommunications,” see below.\n\n11 = MARITIME (INCLUDES PORTS AND MARITIME FACILITIES)\nIncludes civilian maritime: attacks against fishing ships, oil tankers, ferries, yachts, etc. (Attacks on fishermen are coded as “Private Citizens and Property,” see below).\n\n12 = NGO\nIncludes attacks on offices and employees of non-governmental organizations (NGOs). NGOs here include large multinational non-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross and Doctors without Borders, as well as domestic organizations.\n\n13= OTHER\nThis value includes acts of terrorism committed against targets which do not fit into other categories. Some examples include ambulances, firefighters, and international demilitarized zones.\n\n14= PRIVATE CITIZENS & PROPERTY\nThis value includes attacks on individuals, the public in general or attacks in public areas including markets, commercial streets, busy intersections and pedestrian malls. Also includes ambiguous cases where the target/victim was a named individual, or where the target/victim of an attack could be identified by name, age, occupation, gender or nationality. This value also includes ceremonial events, such as weddings and funerals. The GTD contains a number of attacks against students. If these attacks are not expressly against a school, university or other educational institution or are not carried out in an educational setting, these attacks are coded using this value. Also, includes incidents involving political supporters as private citizens and property, provided that these supporters are not part of a government-sponsored event. Finally, this value includes police informers. Does not include attacks causing civilian casualties in businesses such as restaurants, cafes or movie theaters (these categories are coded as “Business” see above).\n\n15 = RELIGIOUS FIGURES/INSTITUTIONS\nThis value includes attacks on religious leaders, (Imams, priests, bishops, etc.), religious institutions (mosques, churches), religious places or objects (shrines, relics, etc.). This value also includes attacks on organizations that are affiliated with religious entities that are not NGOs, businesses or schools. Attacks on religious pilgrims are considered “Private Citizens and Property;” attacks on missionaries are considered religious figures.\n\n16 = TELECOMMUNICATION\nThis includes attacks on facilities and infrastructure for the transmission of information. More specifically this value includes things like cell phone towers, telephone booths, television transmitters, radio, and microwave towers.\n\n17 = TERRORISTS/NON-STATE MILITIAS\nTerrorists or members of identified terrorist groups within the GTD are included in this value. Membership is broadly defined and includes informants for terrorist groups, but excludes former or surrendered terrorists.\nThis value also includes cases involving the targeting of militias and guerillas.\n\n18 = TOURISTS\nThis value includes the targeting of tour buses, tourists, or “tours.” Tourists are persons who travel primarily for the purposes of leisure or amusement. Government tourist offices are included in this value. The attack must clearly target tourists, not just an assault on a business or transportation system used by tourists. Travel agencies are coded as business targets.\n\n19 = TRANSPORTATION (OTHER THAN AVIATION)\nAttacks on public transportation systems are included in this value. This can include efforts to assault public buses, minibuses, trains, metro/subways, highways (if the highway itself is the target of the attack), bridges, roads, etc. The GTD contains a number of attacks on generic terms such as “cars” or “vehicles.” These attacks are assumed to be against “Private Citizens and Property” unless shown to be against public transportation systems. In this regard, buses are assumed to be public transportation unless otherwise noted.\n\n20 = UNKNOWN\nThe target type cannot be determined from the available information.\n\n21 = UTILITIES\nThis value pertains to facilities for the transmission or generation of energy. For example, power lines, oil pipelines, electrical transformers, high tension lines, gas and electric substations, are all included in this value. This value also includes lampposts or street lights. Attacks on officers, employees or facilities of utility companies excluding the type of facilities above are coded as business.\n\n22 = VIOLENT POLITICAL PARTIES\nThis value pertains to entities that are both political parties (and thus, coded as “government” in this coding scheme) and terrorists. It is operationally defined as groups that engage in electoral politics and appear as “Perpetrators” in the GTD.",
