# Time spent, participation time, and participation rates - Eurostat

This Eurostat data set measures the time spent, participation time, and participation rate in 55 activities. 

For the purposes of illustrating how time use has changed over time, we have aggregated the 55 activities under six main headings provided in the original Eurostat source. The six headings are (1) Personal care; (2) Employment, related activities, and travel; (3) Study; (4) Household and family care; (5) Leisure, social, and associative life; and (6) Travel and unspecified time use. The data has been normalised to 1440 minutes per day. 

The survey population includes private participants only - individuals living in institutions (nursing homes, homes for the elderly, childrenâ€™s homes, rehabilitation centres and penitentiary) are excluded.
