# Total value of exports by country to world (%GDP) (OWID calculations based on Fouquin and Hugot (CEPII 2016) and other sources)

Whenever possible, the source reports data on merchandise trade, excluding trade in services and re-exports. Some specific goods are also excluded (the authors highlight the omission of bullion and species in historical data).

Since re-exports are excluded, special import data is favored over general import data (special imports have the importing country as their final destination, whereas general trade is composed of special trade, together with transit trade).

To calculate total exports to the rest of the world as a share of GDP, using the UK as an example, figures have been calculated as follows:

UK-exports-to-the-world-as-share-of-GDP = [exports-to-A + exports-to-B + exports-to-C] / GDP-of-UK (this calculation would assume there are a total of three countries in the entire sample constituting the rest of the world).

Export values used rely on the estimate given by the importer as the authors note: "importers have a greater incentive to properly assess trade flows as they are commonly subject to duties". Bilateral trade flows are recorded in current British pounds.

 Fouquin and Hugot (CEPII 2016) data uses the IMF's Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS) dataset extensively from 1948 until the present day.

West Germany estimates have been used between 1950 - 1990, and Germany's trade estimates used before 1950 and after 1990. Estimates for East Germany have been excluded.

Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, and the Bahamas have also been excluded from the sample due to insufficient data availability.
