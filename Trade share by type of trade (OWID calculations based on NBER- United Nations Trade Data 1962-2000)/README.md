# Trade share by type of trade (OWID calculations based on NBER- United Nations Trade Data 1962-2000)

The total value of exports calculated for the NBER-United Nations Datasets includes only trade in goods, classified according to the 4 digit Standard International Trade Classification, Revision 2. Authors give primacy to importers' reports whenever they are available, assumed to be more accurate.

OWID calculations have excluded all observations for the 'World' with the focus on bilateral country trade flows. Countries Comoros, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and the Netherlands Antilles have also been excluded from the sample as, in the case of the former two, multiple countries are included in these labels in the NBER-UN data, and hence would be inaccurate to calculate the trade share by national GDP. For the Netherlands Antilles there is insufficient alternative trade data by the World Bank and other sources to check whether the figures are correctly estimated. 

The United Kingdom consists of: the UK, British Antarctic Territories, the Falkland Islands, and Saint Helena. 
Germany consists of: East Germany, West Germany, and Germany. 
Russia: the former USSR and Russia. 
France: French Guinea, Guadeloupe, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and France. 
Yemen: the Yemen Arab Republic, the Yemen People's Republic, and Yemen. 

All countries defined to be resource rich have been excluded from the sample. The list of these countries include: the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Niger, Guinea, Mali, Chad, Mauritania, Laos, Zambia, Vietnam, Yemen, Nigeria, Cameroon, Papua New Guinea, Sudan, Uzbekistan, Cote d'Ivoire, Bolivia, Mongolia, Congo, Iraq, Indonesia, Timor, Syria, Guyana, Turkmenistan, Angola, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea. The list is taken from the IMF resource: https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2012/082412.pdf on page 48, Appendix 1, Table 1. 

Capital vs labor intensive countries have been categorised using the World Bank's 2016 income classification. Low and lower-middle income countries have been classified as labor intensive while upper-middle and high-income countries as capital intensive. The 2016 classification has been applied to all previous years for which there is data.

To calculate export trade share to labor-intensive countries, using the UK as an example, figures have been calculated as follows:
UK-exports-to-labor-intensive-countries-as-share-of-GDP = [exports-to-A + exports-to-B + exports-to-C] / GDP-of-UK (this calculation would assume there are a total of three developing countries in the entire sample).
