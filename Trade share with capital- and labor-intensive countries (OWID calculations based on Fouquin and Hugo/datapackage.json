  "description": "Capital and labor-intensive countries have been defined according to the World Bank’s 2016 income classifications as our starting point. Low and lower-middle income countries have been classified as labor-intensive while upper-middle income and high income countries as capital-intensive. The 2016 classification has been applied to all previous years for which there is data available. Where no World Bank classification is available for self-governing territories, the observation is assigned the country classification to which it is related. For example, Saint Pierre and Miquelon would be assigned France's income classification. \n\nAll countries defined to be resource rich have been excluded from the sample to focus on the trade between rich countries and countries that are labor-abundant but capital and resource poor. The list of resource rich countries excluded are: the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Niger, Guinea, Mali, Chad, Mauritania, Laos, Zambia, Vietnam, Yemen, Nigeria, Cameroon, Papua New Guinea, Sudan, Uzbekistan, Cote d'Ivoire, Bolivia, Mongolia, Congo, Iraq, Indonesia, Timor, Syria, Guyana, Turkmenistan, Angola, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea. The list is taken from the IMF resource: https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2012/082412.pdf on page 48, Appendix 1, Table 1. \n\nTo calculate export trade share to labor-intensive countries, using the UK as an example, figures have been calculated as follows:\nUK-exports-to-labor-intensive-countries-as-share-of-GDP = [exports-to-A + exports-to-B + exports-to-C] / GDP-of-UK (this calculation would assume there are a total of three labor-intensive countries in the entire sample). \n\nExport values used rely on the estimate given by the importer as the authors note: \" importers have a greater incentive to properly assess trade flows as they are commonly subject to duties\". Bilateral trade flows are recorded in current British pounds.\n\nWest Germany estimates have been used between 1950 - 1990, and Germany's trade estimates used before 1950 and after 1990.  Estimates for East Germany have been excluded. Please see the original document providing a detailed description of the data set used, including country and territory definitions, available at: http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/fr/publications/wp/abstract.asp?NoDoc=9134\n\nMicronesia, Marshall Islands, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, and the Bahamas have also been excluded from the sample due to insufficient data availability.
