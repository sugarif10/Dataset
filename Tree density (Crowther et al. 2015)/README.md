# Tree density (Crowther et al. 2015)

The authors used 429,775 ground-sourced measurements of tree density from every continent on Earth except Antarctica to generate a global map of forest trees.

They define a tree as a plant with woody stems larger than 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH).

Tree density (per square kilometer and per capita) were calculated by the authors based on population and land area data sourced from the World Bank for 2014.
