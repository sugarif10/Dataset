(2015) and Pearson Schools and Colleges, Poverty, public health and the state in Britain, c1780–1939. Note that this data represents total death toll for major pandemic years (and is given as the total death toll for the outbreak period e.g. in data for 1832 represents the total deaths across the 1831-32 outbreak). The death toll from cholera between these outbreaks was much lower than such peaks, although exact figures are not known. These are given as the total death toll in Great Britain (representing England, Wales and Scotland).\r\n\r\n\r\nData from 1910 onward is for England and Wales only.
