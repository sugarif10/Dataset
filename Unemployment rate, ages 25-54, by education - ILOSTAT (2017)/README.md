# Unemployment rate, ages 25-54, by education - ILOSTAT (2017)

The unemployment rate is the number of persons who are unemployed as a percent of the total number of employed and unemployed persons (i.e., the labour force). Data by level of education are provided on the highest level of education completed.

According to the ISCED-11 classification, a 'less than basic education' may refer to no schooling, or early childhood education.  'Basic education' includes primary or lower secondary education; 'Intermediate education' to upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education; 'Advanced education' can refer to short-cycle tertiary education, Bachelor's or equivalent level, Master's or equivalent level, or Doctoral or equivalent level, while 'level not stated' is an education level not elsewhere classified.
