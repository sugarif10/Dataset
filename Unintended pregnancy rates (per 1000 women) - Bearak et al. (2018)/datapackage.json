The predictors were the numbers of women of reproductive age in each of the three subgroups of women (married women with an unmet need, married women experiencing failure with a contraceptive method, and all unmarried women).\"\n\nThis is measured as the number of unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women of reproductive age (15-44 years old).\n\nData was reported over the period 1990-2014 in five-year intervals.
