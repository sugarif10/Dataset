# Urbanization share (European Commission, Atlas of the Human Planet)

Data reports the share of people living in urban areas, as reported by the European Commission project. These results differ significantly from UN and nationally-defined figures based on differences in methodology.

The European Commission combines high-resolution satellite imagery with national census data to derive its estimates of urban and rural settlements.

The European Commission applied a universal definition of settlements across all countries:

- Urban centre: must have a minimum of 50,000 inhabitants plus a population density of at least 1500 people per square kilometre (km2) or density of build-up area greater than 50 percent.
- Urban cluster:Â must have a minimum of 5,000 inhabitants plus a population density of at least 300 people per square kilometre (km2).
- Rural: fewer than 5,000 inhabitants.

The urban share is thereafter defined as the sum of urban centres and urban clusters.
