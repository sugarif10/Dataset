# Volcanic eruption deaths (NGDC/NOAA)

Data represents the estimated number of deaths from volcanic eruption events. This includes direct deaths from volcanic eruptions, in addition to secondary impacts (such as a tsunami or earthquake triggered by an eruption).

Our World in Data have aggregated significant earthquake numbers by country/location per year. 

Due to data availability, reporting and evidence, it's expected that more recent data will be more complete than the long historical record.
