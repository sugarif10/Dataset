  "description": "The Women's Economic Opportunity (WEO) Index measures five categories to determine whether the environment for both women employees and women entrepreneurs is favourable. Five category scores are calculated from the unweighted mean of underlying indicators and scaled 0-100, where 100=most favourable. These categories are: Labor policy and practice (comprising two sub-categories: Labor policy and labor practice); Access to Finance; Education and training; Women's legal and social status; and the General business environment. Each category or sub-category features either four or five underlying indicators.\n\nThe overall score (from 0-100) is calculated from a simple average of the unweighted category and indicator variables. That is, every indicator contributes equally to their parent category and every category contributes equally to the overall score.\n\nEIU note: The criteria used in this study were chosen in close consultation between the Economist Intelligence Unit and panels of experts, mostly in 2009 and 2010. The indicator list was reviewed and revised at an experts meeting held at the offices of UN Women in July 2011.\n\nWorld Bank classifications include entities: High income (OECD), High income, High income (non-OECD), Upper-middle income, Lower-middle income, Low income, Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, East Asia & Pacific, Middle East & North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. \n\nUN classifications include entities: Europe, Americas, Oceania, Asia, and Africa.",
