This is the time of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–45).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* For the years 1861 and 1860 China has no data in Polity IV. Here the score -6 which is the score in the period before and after is assigned. 1861 is the year of the Battle of Shanghai during the Taiping Rebellion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* For India the Polity IV has no data for 1947, 1948, and 1949 – the time of the \"Partition of India\". For the period after the Polity IV score is 9; here this score is used from 1947 (the year of independence from Britain).\r\n\r\nThe data on the countries’ population is taken from Gapminder and for the total world population from Our World In Data. The difference between the total of number of people for which information on the country regime was available and the total world population is reported as \"Country in tranistion or no data\".\r\n\r\nThe missing countries and all observations and regimes for each country over time can be studied directly here: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/political-regime-updated2016?year=2015\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPopulation by country data comes from the following sources:\r\n\r\n* Before 1950: From Gapminder.org\r\n\r\n* 1950-2015: UN Population Division (2015 Revision)\r\n\r\n* 2016 onwards: Medium Variant – UN Population Division (2015 Revision)",
